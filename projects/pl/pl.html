        <p>
            The main goal of this project is to create an interpreter for my project language. I accomplished this using Java and the JavaCC tool.

    <h1 class = "head">Project Language</h1>
    <div id = "overviewdiv">
        <p>
            To the right is the context-free syntax of the project language in Extended BNF notation. <br><br>This language combines imperative and functional features and is primarily based on SML. 
            The language is statically scoped and dynamically typed.

     <h1 class = "head">Parser Implementation</h1>
     <div id = "overviewdiv">
         <p>
            I first used the JavaCC tool to generate a purse parser, ProjLangParser, for my language. I expressed the language syntax using EBNF. 
            This parser was tested using the ParseMain.java file which created a ProjLangParser object and used input from standard input.

            I then modified this parser so that I would be able to enforce static and dynamic semantic rules in addition to 
            ensuring syntatic validality. To implement semantic constructs into the project I modified the previous JavaCC parser by
            adding return types to the non-terminals as well as including actions in the grammar rules to the right of these non-terminals. 
            This allowed the parser to return an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). 
        
            <br><br><b>Abstract Syntax Tree:</b>
            <br><br>In this project, the AST was simply an object that invokes the evaluator method defined for its class.  
            I defined an expression class, Expr.Java, that has several subclasses for each of the possible expressions that can
            be evaluated for this language. <br><br>These subclasses would be required to define their own evaluation methods that evaluates 
            the input per its semantic rules. For instance, I implemented a LetValExp and WhileExp subclass. 

            <br><br><b>Testing:</b>
            <br><br>This parser was tested using InterpretMain.java which created a ProjLangParser object and used input from standard input. It uses this
            input to create an expression object which would invoke its evaluation method.
